Our programming language named by "leaf" has name come from group members names. Leaf is in Turkish "Yaprak".

This is initially done for Programming Language homework in Akdeniz University Computer Science Engineering program.

Our language is designed as  syntax of the algorithms in CAPSLOCK form. Our language is mainly under effect of Java language syntax.

 ## Syntax

## How to run ?

- First, to build project run "make" command.

- Second, to run project run "make run" command. 

- Third, to clear builds run "make clear" command.
